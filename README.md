# Testing-practice

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)

In this exercise, I wrote a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library. I also made sure to follow the AAA pattern to make my tests easier for other developers to read and understand. I also used the TDD approach in practice.

> Learning objectives

- Write unit tests for a JavaScript app.
- Use AAA pattern for unit tests.
- Explain why testing code is important.
